Hi! My name is Amit Aides, a computer vision researcher at IBM, where I study
deep-learning for tasks like object detection and audio-visual algorithms.
I like learning new things, working with people and building complex systems
and machines. Luckily, during my Ph.D. studies I had the opportunity to combine
most of these preferences, both in my research and in projects I took part in. 

I am an electrical engineer by training. I received my B.Sc., M.Sc. and Ph.D.
at the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology. For details on my M.Sc. and
Ph.D. please visit my [Research](/research/) page.

Thanks for visiting!
