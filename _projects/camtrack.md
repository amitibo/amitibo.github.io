CamTrack was a [Shareware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareware) that my
brother, [Nir Aides](http://winpdb.org/) and I developed in the beginning of the
21<sup>st</sup> century. Our vision was to do to video
chatting what [emoticons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticon) did to textual
chat. Nowadays the idea sounds trivial but at that time (pre iPhone era) it
was innovative and was later copied and further developed by many others.
