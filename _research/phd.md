I completed my Ph.D. at the Electrical Engineering faculty at the Technion,
Israel Institute of Technology. The subject of my thesis was the recovery the
three-dimensional (3D) distribution of aerosols and water droplets in the the
atmosphere. The thesis had a theoretical side, where I developed 3D
single-scattering tomography<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> and later co-developed
multi-scattering tomography<sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>. The thesis had a very
large experimental side where I built several camera networks to collect data
and prove the feasibility of our methods.

Below is a screen-cast demonstrating the GUI I developed for controlling the
camera network:

Here is time-lapse of the a whole day captured by the camera network:

Here is an example of water cloud distribution recovered from images captured
using the camera network:

Below is a clip showcasing the sprinklers action. The sprinklers are used for
removing dust that accumulates on the glass dome:

Here is the latest (5<sup>th</sup> generation) camera network which
enabled radiometric measurements, was waterproof and equipped with water
sprinklers that cleaned the camera lens from dust. The camera network was
deployed on and around [Mount Carmel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Carmel)
which can be seen in the background.

And here is the 1<sup>st</sup> generation camera network used in our first
experiments<sup id="a3">[3](#f3)</sup>:
